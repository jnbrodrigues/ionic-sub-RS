# 'Graph recommender system for ionic substitution: Discovering new materials' repository

This repo is a data repository for the resulting data generated for the paper "Graph recommender system for ionic substitution: Discovering new materials" by Elton Ogoshi et al.  

It also provides classes for manipulating the data and the trained models with the objective to recommend ion-site accupations, which can be used to generate possibly new stable compounds.
